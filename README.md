Requirements
-----------

To work things properly, J-Painter uses [WebLaF](https://github.com/mgarin/weblaf) 1.28 - an awesome look and feel theme from [mgarin](https://github.com/mgarin). WebLaF is released under GNU General Public License (GPLv3).

The application is tested to run on Java Version 7 Update 45 or above. There's no guarantee that it will run smoothy on older versions.

<br>
Setup
----
Include WebLaF jar file ```weblaf-complete-1.28.jar``` to the application classpath. For more information please visit the WebLaF [wiki page](https://github.com/mgarin/weblaf/wiki/How-to-use-WebLaF).
